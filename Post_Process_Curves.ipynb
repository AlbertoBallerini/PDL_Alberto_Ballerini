    "# Post-Process of Experimental In-cylinder Pressure Curves to obtain Heat Release Rate Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Author: Alberto Ballerini, STEN Ph.D. student, 38th cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "This code aims to provide an estimation of the Heat Release Rate ($\\textit{HRR}$ measured in [J/CAD]) curve from experimental in-cylinder pressure data. The $\\textit{HRR}$ measures the power released by the combustion of the fuel, and it can be used to study how the combustion process is evolving over time. \n",
    "This quantity is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textit{HRR} = \\frac{dm_\\textit{f,b}}{d\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m_\\textit{f,b}$ is the burned mass of fuel and $\\theta$ is the crank angle degree measured in [CAD].\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, from experimental data, it is only possible to derive the so-called Apparent Heat Release Rate ($\\textit{AHRR}$  measured in [J/CAD]) curve, with the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textit{AHRR} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}\\cdot p \\frac{dV}{d\\theta} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma - 1} \\cdot V\\frac{dp}{d\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $p$ is the in-cylinder pressure in [Pa];\n",
    "- $V$ is the cylinder volume in [m$^3$];\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the ratio of the constant-pressure specific heat and constant-volume specific heat $\\gamma = \\frac{c_p}{c_v}$;\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the value of $\\textit{AHRR}$ includes the heat transfer between the mixture contained in the combustion chamber and its walls. \n",
    "With the knowledge of the heat exchanged with the walls $\\frac{dQ_\\textit{walls}}{d\\theta}$ it is possible to derive the $\\textit{HRR}$ from the $\\textit{AHRR}$ with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textit{HRR} =\\textit{AHRR} + \\frac{dQ_\\textit{walls}}{d\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, in order to estimate correctly the $\\textit{HRR}$ from experimental values it is necessary to evaluate the istantaneous heat transfer rate with a specific submodel. In this case the model proposed by Woschni will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another typical flaw of the $\\textit{AHRR}$ formulation presented before is the utilization of a constant $\\gamma$. This is done as no experimental informations about the composition and temperature of the charge inside the cylinder are usually available. For this reason, in first approximation, the $\\textit{AHRR}$ curve derived is not very representative of the combustion process that is actually happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for these issues, this code provides an estimation of both the heat transfer and the charge composition to have a better evaluation of the $\\textit{HRR}$ through an iterative process. The iterative process stops when the cumulated value of the $\\textit{HRR}$ (called Heat Release $\\textit{HR}$ measured in [J]) matches the experimental value, as it will be later defined."
